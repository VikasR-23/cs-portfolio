    What I Created
    </h1>
    
    <p1 style="text-align: justify;">In this session we built off what we had previously learned with javascirpt and HTML to make it more interactive and usable for the user. This time we got an 
    introduction into using addEventListeners as well as getElements. We also were introduced to DOM functions and innerHTML. Using these we began applying 
     them to different interactive aspects such as changing color or moving objects with buttons.Before wroking on my interactive page, I completed 3 checkpoints prior, these helped to develop the simple skill of being able to create an input and have some sort of output occur. Finally when we built a calculator in the final checkpoint we were introduced into creating functions that actually completed some form of calculations and ran through an if else statement before making a decision and displaying an output.

    <h1>
        Specifics/Code
    </h1>
    
    
    <p2> <strong>addEventListeners:</strong> Starting of the project we were introduced to <mark>addEventListeners</mark>. The main function for addEventListeners is so that you can add as specific effect or result of an input from the user such as a click,hover, etc.
    You can use these addEventListeners to place a certain function for one property or item, such as a object or button. They can be used to carry out a function for a whole set of objects. The image below displays a <mark> for loop </mark> using an array. If you look at the html code, you can see that each button has been assigned a <mark>class</mark>.
    Once so, we can go back to our javascirpt and write a <mark>getElementsByClassName</mark> with a variable assigned to it. The class name it will call will be the same as the one we assigned to all the buttons in the HTML file.
    We have now created an array. Finally the for loop uses this array to add a click property to all the buttons with only one line of code. But this isn't the only way to complete this task of adding a click property to the buttons. 
    As I began building my calculator using an <mark>array</mark> wasn't my first choice. I originally started with a seperate onclick property for each single button in the calculator and connecting it to my javascript function. But later decided to use and array and addEventListener
    instead due to the convienience of having it all connected into one line of code.
        </p2>

    <p3>
        <strong>getElementsByClassName/ById:</strong> Alongside the addEventListener we had to use <mark>getElementsByClassName</mark>. As shown before we used this to create the array we would call using the for loop. 
        We created a variable and set that varibale to call the <mark>Id</mark> or <mark>Class</mark> we had set in the HTML file. And once we have done this we can use it multiple times to assign different properties and functions to it. 
        Such as the click property we added. For the specifics of the for loop. To start off we assigned the value zero to a variable <mark>var i = 0</mark>. This is important because this is how the program will have to make a decision on it's own.
        Then we tell it that if the value of i is less then the array of values on the calculator, <mark>i < calcbutton.length;</mark>, add the click property to <mark>i</mark>. This is an example of telling the program to listen for an event that takes place on the webpage from the user,
        and the decision the program has to make based of the information we have told it.     <br>

        
        
        </p3>

    
    
   
    
    <p5><strong><br>innerHTML: </strong> The <mark>innerHTML</mark> property can be used in javascirpt to maniuplate the HTML page alongside with the outher DOM functions as I mentioned before such as getElementById/classname.
    By using innerHTML I was able to complete the function for my calculator. The image below displays the function I wrote that tells the program what to display when certain buttons are pressed.
    The function says <mark>if (clicked == '=')</mark> then <mark>eval(input.innerHTML);</mark>. This first part states that if the equals sign is clicked then call the innerHTML for the whatever is attached to the <mark>id</mark> I created "input".
    In this case I assigned the id to the table I made that contains the content for my calculator. The rest states that if that is not true then display a value of zero if "AC" button is pressed, as well as if the value is 0 that means it has been clicked.

    <h1>What decisions did I have to make?</h1>
    
    <p6> When programming there were multiple choices I had to make starting with my color choices to the font size, up to the orientation of the images and text on the page.
        With the headers I had to decide whcih font I was  going to use, the color it was and the placement of the header. One of the important choices I made when
        it came to appearence was the color for the headers and the background. I had go through various color options to find one where the color of the headers 
        matched the color of the background. I ended up with a blue colored theme for my webpage. But colors weren't the only desicion I had to make. One of the most important components on a website is the orientation of the the images and text. On my website a desicion I made regarding this was deciding to center the image list of the all my hobbies.
        I came to this desicion due to how I felt it would make the website more appealing and attractive. These decisions were for asthetics, but I also had to make decisions when it came to the technical side of the code and program. One instance is when I had to decide whether I was going to add a seperate onclick function to each
        calculator button or find a simpler way. After asking for help and researching I figured how to complete the same function with only few simple lines of code. I ended up create an array in which I used a for loop with an addEventListener to complete the same task that took around 15 onclick functions to do the same job.

        <h1>How has my view of HTML and JS changed?</h1>
        
    <p6> 
    Originally before I started this class I had some knowledge about HTML. Now after completing my 3rd session in this class, I feel I have established a strong and wroking understanding of the basics of both HTML and Javascript. As well as to creating a foundation for the languages, I think this class has helped cement my passion in coding and software. Coming into this class I knew what these languages were used for as well as had messed around with them. I had already learned python and c++ but never really done JS and HTML But after starting this class and 
    really learning the basics of the coding in HTML and Javascript it started to interest me in learning and developing my skills with it even more on my own. 
    I started researching more on things that I hadn't learned in class. And now I've become more interested in learning more about what can be done with HTML, JS, css and other languages.

    <h1>
        What would I have done differently
        
    </h1>
    
    <p6>Somethings I wanted to incorporate and learn more about is a more interactive navbar as well as adding more customization to the website. So far my main interactive aspects of my website rely on my dropdwon menu and the calculator.
    I would have liked to add some more interactive peices to my webpage such as a game or quiz. But because of the time it took to complete my calculator, I wasn't able to fully reach my goal. for this reason next session some ways I can help myself improve my chances of reaching my goal is better time management and efficiency.</p6>
